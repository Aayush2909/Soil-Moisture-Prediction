# Soil-Moisture-Prediction

A Deep Learning Model that predicts Soil Moisture Content on the basis of three major factors- Soil temperature, Air temperature and Relative Humidity Percentage.
It is a Multi-Layer perceptron that uses Regression as the ML technique for prediction. Python DL libraries like tensorflow and Keras are used to build the model for the same.
Dataset used for the same has been provided in a Comma-seperated File Format.
